                        Access to the Physical Networking Device Lab Environment (GearNet Lab) at the University of Cincinnati is a privilege granted to students for educational and research purposes.

                                <strong>Eligible Users:</strong> The GearNet Lab is exclusively available for use by currently enrolled students and faculty members of the University of Cincinnati. Use of the lab by individuals who do not meet the criteria is strictly prohibited.

                                <strong>Accountability:</strong> The University of Cincinnati Libraries, which oversee the lab environment, cannot monitor or control all activities within the lab. Users are individually responsible for their actions and the content they access.

                            <strong>Breach of Policy:</strong> Violation of any aspect of this policy may lead to the loss of lab privileges. The lab administrators reserve the right to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Monitor and/or terminate a user's session without notice.</li>

                                More serious and/or repeated violations can result in removal from that user’s current education program and contacting local law enforcement.
                        <br><br>
                                In the event that GearNet lab equipment is damaged or stolen by a student or faculty member, the person responsible for said action will be held accountable, and it is within the rights of the University of Cincinnati to request financial compensation for the device in question.
                        <br><br>
                                Additionally, users must recognize that the lab's databases and electronic resources are governed by license agreements, the terms of which must be respected. Specific devices may carry their own terms and conditions, which take precedence over these general guidelines.
                        <br><br>
                                <strong>Policy Concerns:</strong> For any questions or concerns related to this policy or specific lab resources, please contact the lab administrators or the designated lab coordinator. It is the responsibility of all lab users to understand and adhere to this Acceptable Use Policy.
